I created a form at the top of my site for users to fill out and leave messages. I'm hopeing
when recruiters visit my site, they could let me know that they visited or other users could
leave me messages with improvements or other ideas they may have. 

I also added Google Analytics tracking to my site and by using the gtag function, 
I could monitor the number of views the different pages on my website have.
